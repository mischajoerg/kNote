kNote
=====

simple Notepad written in Python with Kivy. The GUI is working but still haven´t solved the problem how to get
the textinput. there´s also a bug when you the virtual keyboard is shown and you click on the button save/close
the keyboard is over the popup. trying to fix those bugs soon.

another thing is that i didn´t use a .kv-file because i´m not yet familiar to it. perhaps it would have been an
easiere way to do it. i´ll check.

cheers
